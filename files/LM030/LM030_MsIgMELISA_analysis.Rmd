# This is a description of the variables and terms defined in the 'fit' model.
# x = the independent variable (Absorbance) (Concentration, estimated from the Absorbance)
# y = the dependent variable 
# The 4 estimated parameters consist of the following:

# the minimum value that can be obtained. (this is the ABS at conc. 0)
# a = fit$coefficients[2] 

# d = the maximum value that can be obtained (i.e. what happens at infinite dose)

# c = the point of inflection (i.e. the point on the S shaped curve halfway between a and d)

# b = Hillâ€™s slope of the curve (i.e. this is related to the steepness of the curve at point c).

# Generate points from  model. Pick range from logconc
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 4, length=1000) 

# from OD ~ d + (a - d)/(1 + (logconc/cc)^b)
