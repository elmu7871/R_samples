LM003

This experiment is a TGF-B stimulation timecourse focused on short timepoints in order to examine signaling pathway components in WB.
I'll look at both canonical (SMAD 2/3) and non-canonical (p38, JNK, ERK, AKT) pathway components.
Timepoints to be colletced:
0min
5min
15min
30min
60min
120min

Cells will be collected in RIPA for WB analysis.
